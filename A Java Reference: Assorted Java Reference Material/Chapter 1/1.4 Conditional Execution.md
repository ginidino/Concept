# Conditional Execution

## If statements
*If statement* form:
```java
if (condition) then-part
  // or
if (condition) then-part else else-part
```
- *condition* → `boolean` expression   
  - If it evaluates to `true`, the program executes the then-part (a statement), and otherwise the else-part, which simply defaults to the empty statement if absent.   
- Need to have *then-part* or *else-part* contain more than one statement.   
- The trick used for this purpose (and for other constructs that have a “statement” part that needs to be several statements) is to use a kind of statement called a *block*.   
- A block consists of any number of statements (including zero) enclosed in curly braces (`{ }`).   
```java
if (3 > 4) {
	System.out.println ("3 > 4.");
	System.out.println ("Looks like we’re in trouble.");
} else {
	System.out.println ("OK");
}
```

## Conditional Expressions
```java
System.out.println(4 > 3 ? "Less" : "More");  // Prints Less
System.out.println (4 < 3 ? "Less" : "More"); // Prints More 
// The next two mean the same, and print 3.1 
System.out.println (1 < 0 ? 1.1 : 1 > 2 ? 2.1 : 3.1); 
System.out.println (1 < 0 ? 1.1 : (1 > 2 ? 2.1 : 3.1));
```
- The expression C ? Et : Ef yields either the value of Et or Ef , depending on whether C evaluates to true or false.
- ‘?’ means roughly “then”
- ‘:’ means “otherwise”
- > The expressions after ‘?’ and ‘:’ must be the same type of thing; 3<4 ? 1 : "Hello" is erroneous.

## Case analysis and the Switch Statement
When find yourself in a situation where need to break some subproblem down into several cases, you can always get by with multiple uses of the `if` statement.
```java
if (x < -10.0) {
	y = 0.0;
} else if (x < 0.0) {
	y = 1.0 / f(-x);
} else if (x < 10.0) {
	y = f(x);
} else {
	y = Double.POSITIVE_INFINITY;
}
```
- This compound `if` statement is so common that we customarily format, instead of indenting the entire `else` part of the first `if`, etc.    

like this:
```java
		if (x < -10.0) {
			y = 0.0;
		} else {
			if (x < 0.0) {
				y = 1.0 / f(-x);
			} else {
				if (x < 10.0) {
					y = f(x);
				} else {
					y = Double.POSITIVE_INFINITY;
				}
			}
		}
	}
```
- encounter programs where first, there are lots of cases, and second, each test is of the form
```java
if (E = some integral constant)
```
where E is the same each time. 
- For this purpose, there is a special construct, introduced with the keyword `switch`.
```java
if (action == PICK_UP) 
  acquireObject ();
else if (action == DROP) 
  releaseObject ();
else if (action == ENTER || action == EXIT) 
  changeRooms (action);
else if (action == QUIT) { 
  cleanUp ();
  return;
} else if (action == CLIMB) 
...
else
  ERROR ();
```
- `action` is some integral variable (this might include character constants as well, but not strings)
- the upper-case names are all defined in a class somewhere as *symbolic constants standing* for integers
- The old-fashioned way to do this
```java
static final int // ’final’ means ’constant’ QUIT = 0,
  PICK_UP = 1,
  DROP = 2,
  ENTER = 3,
  EXIT = 4,
  CLIMB = 5,
  etc.
```
- As a matter of style, whenever you represent some set of possible values with arbitrary integers like this, always introduce meaningful symbols like these
- An arguably clearer way to write the if statement above is with switch, as follows:
```java
switch (action) { 
case PICK_UP:
  acquireObject ();
  break;
case DROP:
  releaseObject ();
  break;
case ENTER: case EXIT:
  changeRooms (action);
  break;
case QUIT:
  cleanUp ();
  return;
case CLIMB:
  ... 
default:
  ERROR (); 
}
```
- `break` statements → leave this `switch` statement
