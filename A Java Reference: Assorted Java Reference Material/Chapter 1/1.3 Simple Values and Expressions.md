# Simple Values and Expressions
In Java, these are various kinds of numbers, characters (as from an alphabet), and booleans (true/false) or they may *structured* into compound values. A programming language construct that produces a value is called an `expression`.

## Writing Numbers
Java has both *`integral`* and *`floating-point`* literals (the difference being that the latter can have fractional parts)
```java
class Numerals {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		// A. All print 42
		System.out.println(42);		// Base 10
		System.out.println(052);	// Base 8 (starts with 0)
		System.out.println(0x2a);	// Base 16 (a = 10, b = 12, ..., f = 15)
		
		// B. All print 31.45
		System.out.println(31.45);
		System.out.println(3.145e1);	// en or En means ×10^n
		System.out.println(3145e-2);
		
		// C. Prints 12345678901
		System.out.println(12345678901L);
	}
}
```

## Arithmetic
Java expressions include the familiar algebraic notation, which you can play with easily enough by putting examples into a `main` function:
```java
class Arithmetic {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		// A. Prints 3
		System.out.println ((3 + 7 + 10) * (1000 - 8) / 992 - 17); 
		// B. Prints 2.7166666666666663
		System.out.println (2.0 + 1.0 / 2 + 1.0 / 6 + 1.0 / 24 + 1.0 / 120); 
		// C. Prints 2
		System.out.println (2 + 1/2 + 1/6 + 1/24 + 1/120);
		// D. Prints -3
		System.out.println (1 - 2 - 2);
		// E. Prints 17
		System.out.println (117 % 20);
		// F. Prints Infinity 
		System.out.println (1.0 / 0.0);
		// G. Prints -2147483648 
		System.out.println (2147483647 + 1); 
		// H. Prints NaN
		System.out.println (0.0 / 0.0);
		// I. Halts the program with an exception 
		System.out.println (1/0);
	}
}
```
```

2
-3
17
Infinity
-2147483648
NaN
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.ArithmeticException: / by zero

These examples look pretty much like what you might write by hand, and illustrate a few more points:
#### ‘`*`’ denotes multiplication and ’`%`’ denotes remainder.
#### Operators have precedences
  - Example B illustrates grouping and Example A uses parentheses to control grouping. 
#### Operators associate
  - Example D illustrates grouping when the operators have the same precedence
  - subtraction (like most operators) associates left (or groups left) with operators of the same precedence.
#### Integer quantities and floating-point quantities are distinct
  - In Java, a number written without a decimal point (an *integral quantity*) is of a different type from one written with a decimal point (a *floating-point quantity*)
  - Division of two integers throws away the fractional part of the answer to yield an integer
  - division of floating-point numbers behaves more like regular mathematics
  - 1/2 yields 0, while 1.0/2.0 yields 0.5
#### Floating-point arithmetic approximates real arithmetic
  - Floating-point arithmetic is a compromise between computational speed and mathematical truth
  - The results of each operation are computed, correctly rounded, to a certain number of binary digits
#### Arithmetic has limited range
  -  Example G: when an integer value becomes too large, the result “wraps around” to the smallest number.
  -  Example F: print as Infinity and -Infinity to represent numbers that are too large in floating point, which are also used when non-zero floating-point numbers are divided by 0
#### Arithmetic nonsense has predictable effects
  - Example H: a floating-point operation with an undefined value yields a strange special value called NaN (for “Not A Number”). 
  - The analogous integer operation causes an error (what Java calls an exception), since for various reasons, there is no available integer to use as NaN.

## Comparisons and Logical Operations
Comparison operators and logical operators produce the two boolean values true and false
```java
class Compare {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		// A. All print true 
		System.out.println (true);
		System.out.println(3 < 4);
		System.out.println(3 <= 4);
		System.out.println(3 <= 3);
		System.out.println(4 > 3);
		System.out.println(4 >= 3);
		System.out.println(3 >= 3);
		System.out.println(4 != 3);
		System.out.println(3 == 3);
		
		// B. All print false
		System.out.println (false);
		System.out.println (3 < 3); 
		System.out.println (3 != 3); 
		// C. All print true
		System.out.println (3 < 4 && 4 < 5); 
		System.out.println (3 > 4 || 4 < 5); 
		System.out.println (! (3 < 4 && 4 < 3)); 
		
		// D. All print true
		System.out.println (3 < 4 || 1/0 == 0);
		System.out.println (! (3 > 4 && 1/0 == 0));
	}
}
```
this is all pretty easy to figure out, once you see the transliterations Java uses for common notations:
```
≤ =⇒ <=       ≥ =⇒ >=
= =⇒ ==       = =⇒ !=
and =⇒&&      or =⇒||
not =⇒ !
```
